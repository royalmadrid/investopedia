===============================================================

Institutional vs. Retail Investors: An Overview 
-------------------------------------------------------

All types of investors are not the same, and there are a number of differences between those who are considered institutional investors and those who are seen as non-institutional, or retail, investors. Understanding the difference is worthwhile. If you are considering an investment in a particular stock or mutual fund that you have seen publicized in the financial press, there is a good chance you do not qualify as an institutional investor. In fact, if you are even wondering what an institutional investor is, you are probably not an institutional investor. Let us take this opportunity to lay out some of the differences.


.. admonition:: 关键要点

    An institutional investor is a person or organization that trades securities in large enough quantities that it qualifies for preferential treatment and lower fees.
    A retail investor is a non-professional investor who buys and sells securities through brokerage firms or savings accounts like 401(k)s.
    Most institutional investors invest other people's money on their behalf.





Understanding Asset Class
-------------------------------------------------------

Simply put, an asset class is a grouping of comparable financial securities. For example, IBM, MSFT, AAPL are a grouping of stocks. Asset classes and asset class categories are often mixed together. There is usually very little correlation, and in some cases a negative correlation, between different asset classes. This characteristic is integral to the field of investing.

Financial advisors view investment vehicles as asset class categories that are used for diversification purposes. Each asset class is expected to reflect different risk and return investment characteristics and perform differently in any given market environment. Investors interested in maximizing return often do so by reducing portfolio risk through asset class diversification.

Financial advisors focus on asset class as a way to help investors diversify their portfolio. Different asset classes have different cash flows streams and varying degrees of risk. Investing in several different asset classes ensures a certain amount of diversity in investment selections. Diversification reduces risk and increases your probability of making a return.

Asset Class and Investing Strategy
-------------------------------------------------------

Investors looking for alpha employ investment strategies focused on achieving alpha returns. Investment strategies can be tied to growth, value, income or a variety of other factors that help to identify and categorize investment options according to a specific set of criteria. Some analysts link criteria to performance and/or valuation metrics such as earnings-per-share growth (EPS) or the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Other analysts are less concerned with performance and more concerned with the asset type or class. An investment in a particular asset class is an investment in an asset that exhibits a certain set of characteristics. As a result, investments in the same asset class tend to have similar cash flows.


Asset Class Types
-------------------------------------------------------

Equities, or stocks; bonds, or fixed-income securities; cash, or marketable securities; and commodities are the most liquid asset classes and, therefore, the most quoted asset classes. There are also alternative asset classes, such as real estate, and valuable inventory, such as artwork, stamps and other tradable collectibles. Some analysts also refer to an investment in hedge funds, venture capital, crowdsourcing or cryptocurrencies as examples of alternative investments. That said, an asset's illiquidity does not speak to its return potential; It only means it may take more time to find a buyer to convert the asset to cash.
